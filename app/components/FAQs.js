          The UNTWIST project operates on the fundamental principle that studying stress adaptation mechanisms in camelina, a naturally resilient European oilseed crop with minimal breeding, can unveil effective stress coping strategies. These strategies, once identified, can then be leveraged to enhance yield stability in camelina and other crops, especially in the face of challenging and shifting environmental conditions.

            UNTWIST is a unique, highly interdisciplinary consortium of four
            research organizations / institutes, one university, one commercial
            SME partner and two non-profit SMEs. These include:

          <p>The module, VisPheno, serves as a comprehensive repository for all collected phenotypic data acquired throughout the project lifecycle. Its primary objective is to furnish users with an in-depth understanding of the distribution of the targeted phenotype. This is accomplished through the utilization of various plot types.</p>

          <p>For instance, to obtain a holistic view of the phenotype, users can generate a straightforward bar plot, providing a visual representation of raw phenotypic data across the entire population. Alternatively, users have the capability to summarize data by extracting key statistical metrics such as minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles, employing box plots to identify potential outliers.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, users can conduct comparative analyses between different phenotypes by contrasting their distributions. This is facilitated by the utilization of violin plots and raincloud plots. In addition, the software empowers users to detect potential confounding factors through the implementation of linReg plots.</p>

          <p>In addition to visualization capabilities, the component offers robust data filtering options, enabling users to construct intricate queries using mathematical and logical operators. Notably, the resulting plot dynamically adapts to reflect these changes, ensuring that users receive real-time feedback and insights.</p>

            <p>
            This component allows for the conducting GWAS analysis on any phenotypic or metabolic traits collected during the project. 
            To this end, stable version of Plink 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink),
            a C/C++ command line program for population genetics analysis is compiled to webassembly module which enables highly scalable in-browser GWAS analysis. 
            This tool enables automated association testing for quantitative  as well qualitative response variable using plink commands (--assoc, --qassoc) made available by plink webassembly module. 
            Additionally, fitting linear regression model implement in plink (--linear), 
            this tool allows one to perform GWAS analysis accounting for population structure in the data using first two principle components (PC1 and PC2) as covariants,
            computed using the same genotypic data being used for GWAS analysis.  
            Following the GWAS analysis, our tool employs JavaScript to seamlessly manage the results.
            Multiple downstream analysis and visualization components operate in parallel, generating essential outputs, including Manhattan plots, QQ-plots, structural annotations, 
            and functional gene annotations (mercator4.5) of the genome. This comprehensive suite of functionalities empowers researchers to explore and interpret GWAS results with precision and efficiency.

          <p>The Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis is seamlessly integrated into the Plink WebAssembly module, facilitating a streamlined workflow for this analytical task. To compute MDS coordinates, the tool is invoked using Plink with a set of specific flags.</p>
          <p>The MDS analysis is initiated with the --read-genome, --cluster, --ppc, and --mds-plot flags. This calculates the first two coordinates of the MDS representation.</p>
          <p>Subsequently, the resulting MDS data is seamlessly integrated with Plotly  to create an illustrative MDS plot, offering a visually intuitive representation of the multidimensional relationships within the data.</p>
          <p>This integrated approach  provides users with a robust and insightful means of exploring multidimensional genetic data.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the resulting plot also shows the respective clusters colored differently based on genome-wide IBS </p>
